# A jQuery UI List Builder widget
The list builder gives you a nice input widget for the users to enter a list of values. The default delimiter that causes an entry to be added to the list is comma, but it can be changed. The widget supports the following features:
- Editing an individual entry
- Deleting an individual entry
- Validating and highlighting an invalid entry
